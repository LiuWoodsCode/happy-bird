# Happy Bird
## Introdution
An **open-source** clone of **Flappy Bird** that I somewhat made. It is very simple, no **IAP**, no **ads**, not even a high scoring system.
## Building
To build, download the Xcode project file and download it. After that, open the **.xcodeproj** file in **Xcode 9** or above. After that, **pick a target** to build to and press the "**Play**" button. Wait for it **to build**, then see it pop up in the **Simulator** or on **your iDevice**.
### What if Happy Bird halts at a black or white screen?
If it doesn't work after an edit, Happy Bird is **kinda fragile**, so if **it stoped working** after an edit, the **only option** is to **redownload** the **.xcodeproj** file and not make the last change that broke the app.
