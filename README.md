# Happy Bird
**NOTICE: You are not permitted to put your own release on the App Store, even for non-profit. However if you change the name, bundle identifier, app icon, organization, launch screen, version number, build number, some game mechanics, and all the sprites, you are premited to put the game on the App Store if you also open source your version as a fork. You also can't make the game so well it goes onto Apple Arcade, or something like that.**
## Introdution
An **open-source** clone of **Flappy Bird** that I made during lockdown in 2020. It is very simple, no **IAP**, no **ads**, not even a high scoring system.
## Building
To build, download the Xcode project file and download it. After that, open the **.xcodeproj** file in **Xcode 10.0** or above. After that, **pick a target** to build to and press the "**Play**" button. Wait for it **to build**, then see it pop up in the **Simulator** or on **your iDevice**.
### What if Happy Bird halts at a black or white screen?
If it doesn't work after an edit, Happy Bird is **kinda fragile**, so if **it stoped working** after an edit, the **only option** is to **redownload** the **.zip with source code** and not make the last change(s) that broke the game.
## Playing
The game **auto-opens** to the **actual game**, which **you control the jumps** with taps on the iDevice. The **game is very simple**, with no **rewards or winning**, only losing when you hit the ground or hit a pipe.
## Is there an IPA or App Store version?
There is an IPA file avalible, though it's only for an iOS Simulator.
## Can you make it work on older devices?
No, at least me. The **games deployment target and some code** is meant for **iOS 11.0 and above**. However **you might be able to make it work** with **older iOS versions** such as iOS 9 and 10  by using **legacy code and APIs,** and setting the **deployment target** to a **lower iOS version.**
## Install | Xcode
Download the Xcode project file and download it. After that, open the **.xcodeproj** file in **Xcode 10.0** or above. After that, **pick your phone** to build to and press the "**Play**" button. Wait for it **to build**, then see it pop up in **your iDevice**.
## Install | AltStore
<details><summary>This won't work as the IPA isn't for normal iOS devices, so this is collapsed by default.</summary>
<p>

Download the IPA to your PC or Mac, then install AltStore **to your device**, then select the **IPA file** in the **Files** app and open it in **AltStore**. Make sure that your device is **linked to a non-Family Sharing Apple ID** and **pluged into** your **PC or Mac.** The app will install.
